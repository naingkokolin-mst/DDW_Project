Test Report for Task 3

    I checked adjustable.html file in W3C valdation website whether this file has error or not.
This website said that I need to add alternative tag in all img tag. So, I added all needed alternative
tags. For all accessibilities, I have to put this alter tag. 
    In basket.html file, the valdation website showed that doesn't have any error or fault. I have already added 
alter tag in img for disabled users. But, I noticed I didn't added access keys.
