Test Report for Task 3

    I checked adjustable.html file in W3C valdation website whether this file has error or not.
This website said that I need to add alternative tag in all img tag. So, I added all needed alternative
tags. For all accessibilities, I have to put this alter tag. 
    In basket.html file, the valdation website showed that doesn't have any error or fault. I have already added 
alter tag in img for disabled users. But, I noticed I didn't added access keys. 
    In contact.html file, the website said I need to change 'for' attribute of the 'label' element in the form
not to be the same. 
    In electric.html and fixed.html files, I need to add alter attribute in all img tags.
    In health_benefits.html page, I need to change name of video that is used in source of the video tag.
The valdation website said that there shouldn't be any space in the name of the that video. So, I changed
the name of the video not to have any space by replacing with underscore.
    I forgot to add alter tag in all images in index.html file.
