Test Report for Task 3

    I checked adjustable.html file in W3C valdation website whether this file has error or not. This website said that I need to add alternative tag in all img tag. So, I added all needed alternative
tags. For all accessibilities, I have to put this alter tag. In basket.html file, the valdation website showed that doesn't have any error or fault. I have already added 
alter tag in img for disabled users. But, I noticed I didn't added access keys. In contact.html file, the website said I need to change 'for' attribute of the 'label' element in the form
not to be the same. In electric.html and fixed.html files, I need to add alter attribute in all img tags. In health_benefits.html page, I need to change name of video that is used in source of the video tag.
The valdation website said that there shouldn't be any space in the name of the that video. So, I changedthe name of the video not to have any space by replacing with underscore.I forgot to add alter tag in all images in index.html file.
    I have already added access keys for all pages to get access for all disabled users. They can directly go to the page 
by clicking Alt + "Access Key". For example, to go to the basket page, the user just need to click (Alt + b). 
    Firstly, I tested my website in the Google Chrome browser and Microsoft Edge browser. I found that there is background image for all web pages in the Chrome, but
I didn't find the background image for all pages in Edge. After searching in Google, Chrome supports .avif image file format.I found that Microsoft Edge 116+ doesn't support the .avif format.
So, Edge doesn't show the background image for the website. 
    For the disabled users, I need to add some accessibilities to use my website. I have not enough time to add each one.
