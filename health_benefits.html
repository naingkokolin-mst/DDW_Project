        <h3 class="title-holder">Why we need Standing Desks?</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Sitting too much is seriously bad for your health. <br>
                People who sit a lot every day have an increased risk of diabetes, heart disease and early death. <br>
                Additionally, sitting all the time burns very few calories, and many studies have linked it to weight
                gain and obesity. <br>
                This is a major problem for office workers, because they sit down for most of the day. Fortunately,
                standing desks are
                becoming increasingly more popular. <br>
                Although research is still in early stages, it does appear that using a standing desk can have
                impressive benefits for
                health. It may also increase productivity. <br>
                At the very least, using this type of desk can partly negate the harmful effects of sitting too much.
                <br>
                Here are 7 benefits of using a standing desk, that are supported by science. <br>
            </p>

        <h3>1. Standing Lowers Your Risk of Weight Gain and Obesity</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Weight gain is ultimately caused by taking in more calories than you burn. <br>
                Conversely, burning more calories than you take in results in weight loss. <br>
                While exercise is the most effective way to burn calories quickly, simply choosing to stand instead of
                sitting can also
                be beneficial. <br>
                In fact, when compared to an afternoon of sedentary work, an equal amount of time spent standing has
                been shown to burn
                over 170 additional calories. <br>
                That’s almost 1000 extra calories burned each week from simply standing at your desk each afternoon.
                <br>
                This caloric difference could be one of the reasons why sitting longer is so strongly linked to obesity
                and metabolic
                disease. <br>

        <h3>2. Using a Standing Desk May Lower Blood Sugar Levels</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Generally speaking, the more your blood sugar levels increase after meals, the worse it is for your
                health. <br>
                This is especially true for those with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes. <br>
                In a small study of 10 office workers, standing for 180 minutes after lunch reduced the blood sugar
                spike by 43%
                compared to sitting for the same amount of time. <br>
                Both groups took the same amount of steps, indicating that the smaller spike was due to standing rather
                than additional
                physical movements around the office. <br>
                Another study involving 23 office workers found that alternating between standing and sitting every 30
                minutes
                throughout the workday reduced blood sugar spikes by 11.1% on average. <br>
                The harmful effects of sitting after meals could help explain why excessive sedentary time is linked to
                a whopping 112%
                greater risk of type 2 diabetes. <br>

        <h3>3. Standing May Lower Your Risk of Heart Disease</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                The idea that standing is better for heart health was first proposed in 1953. <br>
                A study found that bus conductors who stood all day had half the risk of heart disease-related deaths as
                their colleagues in the driver’s seats. <br>
                Since then, scientists have developed a much greater understanding of the effects of sitting on heart
                health, with
                prolonged sedentary time thought to increase the risk of heart disease by up to 147%. <br>
                It is so harmful that even an hour of intense exercise may not make up for the negative effects of an
                entire day spent
                sitting. <br>
                There is no doubt that spending more time on your feet is beneficial for heart health. <br>
                <span class="note">It is widely accepted that the more time you spend sitting, the greater your risk of
                    developing heart disease.</span>

        <h3>4. Standing Desks Appear to Reduce Back Pain</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Back pain is one of the most common complaints of office workers who sit all day. <br>
                To determine if standing desks could improve this, several studies have been done on employees with
                long-term back pain. <br>
                Participants have reported up to a 32% improvement in lower back pain after several weeks of using
                standing desks. <br>
                Another study published by the CDC found that use of a sit-stand desk reduced upper back and neck pain
                by 54% after just
                4 weeks. <br>
                Additionally, removal of the sit-stand desks reversed some of those improvements within a 2-week period.
                <br>
                <span class="note">Several studies show that standing desks can dramatically decrease chronic back pain
                    caused by prolonged sitting.</span>
            </p>

        <h3>5. Standing Desks Help Improve Mood and Energy Levels</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Standing desks appear to have a positive influence on overall well-being. <br>
                In one 7-week study, participants using standing desks reported less stress and fatigue than those who
                remained seated
                the entire work day. <br>
                Additionally, 87% of those using standing desks reported increased vigor and energy throughout the day.
                <br>
                Upon returning to their old desks, overall moods reverted to their original levels.
                These findings align with broader research on sitting and mental health, which links sedentary time with
                an increased
                risk of both depression and anxiety. <br>
                <span class="note">One study found that standing desks can lower feelings of stress and fatigue, while
                    improving mood and energy levels.</span>

        <h3>6. Standing Desks May Even Boost Productivity</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                A common concern about standing desks is that they hinder daily tasks, such as typing. <br>
                While standing each afternoon may take some getting used to, standing desks appear to have no
                significant impact on
                typical work tasks. <br>
                In a study of 60 young office employees, using a standing desk for 4 hours each day had no impact on
                characters typed
                per minute or typing errors. <br>
                Considering that standing improves mood and energy as well, using a standing desk is more likely to
                boost productivity
                rather than hinder it. <br>

        <h3>7. Standing More May Help You Live Longer</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Studies have found a strong link between increased sitting time and early death. <br>
                This is not surprising given the strong association between sedentary time, type 2 diabetes and heart
                disease. <br>
                In fact, a review of 18 studies found those who sit the most are at a 49% greater risk of dying early
                than those who sit
                the least. <br>
                Another study estimated that reducing sitting time to 3 hours per day would raise the average American’s
                life expectancy
                by 2 years. <br>
                While these observational studies do not prove cause and effect, the weight of evidence indicates
                standing more often
                could help lengthen our lifespan. <br>
                <span class="note">Research suggests that reduced sitting time may lower your risk of dying early and
                    therefore help you live longer.</span>

        <h3>It’s Time to Take a Stand</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Reducing sedentary time can improve physical, metabolic and even mental health. This is why sitting less
                and standing
                more is such an important lifestyle change. <br>
                If you want to try this out, then most places who sell office furniture also offer sit-stand desks.
