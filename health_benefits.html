        <h3>Why we need Standing Desks?</h3>
        <div class="paragraph-photo">
            <p>
                Sitting too much is seriously bad for your health. <br>
                People who sit a lot every day have an increased risk of diabetes, heart disease and early death. <br>
                Additionally, sitting all the time burns very few calories, and many studies have linked it to weight
                gain and obesity. <br>
                This is a major problem for office workers, because they sit down for most of the day. Fortunately,
                standing desks are
                becoming increasingly more popular. <br>
                Although research is still in early stages, it does appear that using a standing desk can have impressive benefits for
                health. It may also increase productivity. <br>
                At the very least, using this type of desk can partly negate the harmful effects of sitting too much. <br>
                Here are 7 benefits of using a standing desk, that are supported by science.
