        <h3 class="title-holder">Why we need Standing Desks?</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Sitting too much is seriously bad for your health. <br>
                People who sit a lot every day have an increased risk of diabetes, heart disease and early death. <br>
                Additionally, sitting all the time burns very few calories, and many studies have linked it to weight
                gain and obesity. <br>
                This is a major problem for office workers, because they sit down for most of the day. Fortunately,
                standing desks are
                becoming increasingly more popular. <br>
                Although research is still in early stages, it does appear that using a standing desk can have
                impressive benefits for
                health. It may also increase productivity. <br>
                At the very least, using this type of desk can partly negate the harmful effects of sitting too much.
                <br>
                Here are 7 benefits of using a standing desk, that are supported by science. <br>

        <h3>1. Standing Lowers Your Risk of Weight Gain and Obesity</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Weight gain is ultimately caused by taking in more calories than you burn. <br>
                Conversely, burning more calories than you take in results in weight loss. <br>
                While exercise is the most effective way to burn calories quickly, simply choosing to stand instead of
                sitting can also
                be beneficial. <br>
                In fact, when compared to an afternoon of sedentary work, an equal amount of time spent standing has
                been shown to burn
                over 170 additional calories. <br>
                That’s almost 1000 extra calories burned each week from simply standing at your desk each afternoon.
                <br>
                This caloric difference could be one of the reasons why sitting longer is so strongly linked to obesity
                and metabolic
                disease. <br>

        <h3>2. Using a Standing Desk May Lower Blood Sugar Levels</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Generally speaking, the more your blood sugar levels increase after meals, the worse it is for your
                health. <br>
                This is especially true for those with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes. <br>
                In a small study of 10 office workers, standing for 180 minutes after lunch reduced the blood sugar
                spike by 43%
                compared to sitting for the same amount of time. <br>
                Both groups took the same amount of steps, indicating that the smaller spike was due to standing rather
                than additional
                physical movements around the office. <br>
                Another study involving 23 office workers found that alternating between standing and sitting every 30
                minutes
                throughout the workday reduced blood sugar spikes by 11.1% on average. <br>
                The harmful effects of sitting after meals could help explain why excessive sedentary time is linked to
                a whopping 112%
                greater risk of type 2 diabetes. <br>

        <h3>3. Standing May Lower Your Risk of Heart Disease</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                The idea that standing is better for heart health was first proposed in 1953. <br>
                A study found that bus conductors who stood all day had half the risk of heart disease-related deaths as
                their colleagues in the driver’s seats. <br>
                Since then, scientists have developed a much greater understanding of the effects of sitting on heart health, with
                prolonged sedentary time thought to increase the risk of heart disease by up to 147%. <br>
                It is so harmful that even an hour of intense exercise may not make up for the negative effects of an entire day spent
                sitting. <br>
                There is no doubt that spending more time on your feet is beneficial for heart health. <br>
                <b><i>It is widely accepted that the more time you spend sitting, the greater your risk of developing heart disease.</i></b>
