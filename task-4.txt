a) The choice of the programming language for developing a software is a main key of the development. To create the website for the Standing Desks Ltd, I wrote the code with HTML, CSS and a little of JavaScript. HTML supports the standard structure for developing websites like page headings, text paragraphs and in page links. Since HTML is easy, humans can read and write easily. It is also lightweight language, so, the web pages can be run without delay. The website user can get the smooth UI experience because of HTML and CSS. CSS provides layout structure and style of each HTML element. By using CSS, the website's design can be decorated. It can improve the UI of the web. It is suitable to use these languages when building a website. I used Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge as development tools for web browser. Browser is the vital tool for web developers while creating the website and debugging the codes. Google Chrome supports developer tools that help in scanning and debugging JavaScript, HTML and CSS. That tool also provides another features such as real-time editing of the code, performance analysis. For the techniques, I used media query for creating the website to adjust for different screen sizes and devices. I used flex display, grid images for user experience. For software that I used while building the website is Microsoft VSCode. It is a lightweight code editor. It can be run without any delay. It provides the live-server extension that supports the web can be tested in the browser in real-time without needing to save.
